# Issue Tracker

# To run a project you need to:

npm i - which installs concurrently 

npm run install-dependencies - which installs both client and server dependencies and set up the database

npm run dev - which start client and server 

Unfortunately status change is not implemented, you are still able to set open status on closed/pending issue
